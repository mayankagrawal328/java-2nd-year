Identifier :

A name in java program is called identifier. It may be class name, method name,
variable name and label name.

Rules to define java identifiers:
Rule 1: The only allowed characters in java identifiers are:
1) a to z
2) A to Z
3) 0 to 9
4) _ (underscore)
5) $

Rule 2: If we are using any other character we will get compile time error.
Example: 
1) total_number-------valid
2) Total#------------------invalid

Rule 3: identifiers are not allowed to starts with digit.
Example:
1) ABC123---------valid
2) 123ABC---------invalid
Rule 4: java identifiers are case sensitive up course java language itself treated as case
sensitive language.
Example:
class Test{
int number=10;
int Number=20;
int NUMBER=20; we can differentiate with case.
int NuMbEr=30;
}

Rule 5: There is no length limit for java identifiers 
but it is not recommended to take
more than 15 lengths.

Rule 6: We can't use reserved words as identifiers.
Example:
int if=10; --------------invalid


Rule 7: All predefined java class names and interface names 
we use as identifiers.

Example 1:
class Test
{
public static void main(String[] args){
int String=10;
System.out.println(String);
}}
Output:
10




Example 2:
class Test
{
public static void main(String[] args){
int Runnable=10;
System.out.println(Runnable);
}}
Output:
10





Even though it is legal to use class names and interface names 
as identifiers but it is not
a good programming practice.



Which of the following are valid java identifiers?

_$_
ca$h
java2
java_2_share
all@hands
1234abc
total#
int
integer
Int
total1020



			Reserved words:

In java some identifiers are reserved to associate some 
functionality or meaning such type of reserved identifiers 
are called reserved words.

Reserved words for data types: (8)
1) byte
2) short
3) int
4) long
5) float
6) double
7) char
8) boolean
Reserved words for flow control:(11)
1) if
2) else
3) switch
4) case
5) default
6) for
7) do
8) while
9) break
10) continue
11) return
Keywords for modifiers:(11)
1) public
2) private
3) protected
4) static
5) final
6) abstract
7) synchronized
8) native
9) strictfp(1.2 version)
10) transient
11) volatile
Keywords for exception handling:(6)
1) try
2) catch
3) finally
4) throw
5) throws
6) assert(1.4 version)
Class related keywords:(6)
1) class
2) package
3) import
4) extends
5) implements
6) interface
Object related keywords:(4)
1) new
2) instanceof
3) super
4) this

Void return type keyword:

If a method won't return anything compulsory 
that method should be declared with the
void return type in java but it is optional in C++. 


Unused keywords:
goto: Create several problems in old languages and hence it is 
banned in java.
Const: Use final instead of this.
By mistake if we are using these keywords in our program we will 
get compile time
error.


Reserved literals:
1) true values for boolean data type.
2) false
3)null----------------- default value for object reference.




Enum:
This keyword introduced in 1.5v to define a group of named constants
Example:
enum Beer
{
KF, RC, KO, FO;
}





Conclusions :
1. All reserved words in java contain only lowercase alphabet symbols.
2. New keywords in java are:
3. strictfp-----------1.2v
4. assert-------------1.4v
5. enum--------------1.5v
6. In java we have only new keyword but not delete because destruction of useless
objects is the responsibility of Garbage Collection.


7. instanceof but not instanceOf
8. strictfp but not strictFp
9. const but not Constant
10. syncronized but not syncronize
11. extends but not extend
12. implements but not implement
13. import but not imports
14. int but not Int


Which of the following list contains only java reserved words ?
1. final, finally, finalize  
2. throw, throws, thrown
3. break, continue, return, exit
4. goto, constant(invalid) 
5. byte, short, Integer, long
6. extends, implements, imports
7. finalize, synchronized
8. instanceof, sizeOf
9. new, delete(invalid) 
10. None of the above


Which of the following are valid java keywords?
1. public
2. static
3. void
4. main
5. String
6. args
